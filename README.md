Once upon a time, I fell in love with front-end engineering. It took me months to learn to code. Nowadays, I have fun with CSS, JavaScript, and React. I design and code websites and web applications. Before joining the tech industry, I worked as a full-time corporate lawyer. I decided to exchange my uncomfortable lawyer suit to become an IT geek, and it turned out to be the best decision of my life!
