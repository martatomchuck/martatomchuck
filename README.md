Once upon the time, I felt in love with front-end engineering. It took me months to learn to code. Nowadays, I am having fun with JavaScript, ReactJS and CSS. I design and code websites and web applications. Previously, I've worked as a corporate lawyer but I couldn't stand wearing heels to work every day. My friends call me a mountain freak after I have climbed the highest peak of North Africa.
