Once upon the time, I have fallen in love with front-end engineering. It took me months to learn to code. Nowadays, I am having fun with CSS, JavaScript and React. I design and code websites and web applications. Before joing tech, I've worked as a full-time corporate lawyer. I decided to exchange uncomfy lawyer suit to become an IT geek and it turned out to be the best decision of my life!
