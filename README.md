## Build code, not walls :v:

Once upon the time, I have fallen in love with front-end engineering. It took me months to learn to code. Nowadays, I am having fun with CSS, JavaScript and ReactJS. I design and code websites and web applications. Before joing tech, I've worked as a full-time corporate lawyer but I couldn't stand walking in high heels all day long. My friends call me a mountain freak after I have climbed the highest peak of North Africa.
